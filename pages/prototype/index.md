<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>
    Welcome to the <game name> project. This project began with a collection of friends that wish to sustain the community aspect of tabletop RPGs. This project aims to preserve a core or base edition of rules that folks can continue to play as they choose for as long as we can.
    
    The second aim is to expand upon the base edition in the form of version modules giving the players the flexibility to select which modules and their version they would like to play. It is not up to us to choose your adventure, we are just here to create the pieces that your and your community will weave together into something epic.

    Finally, we would like to fold in the community as much as we can realistically manage. We feel that when the community is given a wholly formed product from some single authority, the only recourse for feedback is via complaints. This creates an adversarial relationship which we would like to avoid. Instead we would like to forge ideas and receive community feedback from their inception. This gives folks the opportunity to help shape the final results. We are not as naive as to think we can please everyone, but by making this project modular and compostable we can get as close as anyone can with a project such as this.

    On behalf of everyone here at the <insert name> project I again welcome you, and look forward to hearing of your adventures.

    Happy playing,
    <character name>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

Prepare yourself to embark on a heroic adventure. Youâ€™ll explore fantastical realms, fight fearsome monsters, solve ancient mysteries, and uncover hidden treasures.

Youâ€™ll create a unique character with their own strengths and weaknesses, choosing from a variety of races and classes. Your choices will shape your destiny, as you navigate a world filled with danger and wonder.

Are you ready to embark on an epic journey?

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

This is the compendium edition. This is a rules lite version of game name. This version is meant for beginners or for faster play (tournament play). All versions of game name have been designed to be compatible. Meaning, if you like your character designed in compendium play then they can be easily converted to a campaign. If you have a group of campaign characters that want a one night dungeon crawler, no worries. See appendix <link> on how to move them hither and thither. This works with all creatures in the beastiary as well. Finally if you love the speed of the compendium edition but donâ€™t like the roll under mechanics, no worries, pull in another that is outlined in the appendix <link>. The players at the table are in control of how they want to play.

<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>

Begin by selecting a background for your character from the table below. If you are having trouble deciding just roll a d20 and take that result. Familiarize yourself with the abilities granted by that background in the [Appendix](appendix#backgrounds) section of this booklet.

Next choose a name for your character or take a recommended name from the names for your characterâ€™s background

### Attributes

Player characters have four attributes
Strength (STR)
Dexterity (DEX)
Willpower (WIL)
Reflex (RFX)

Roll 3d6 for Str, Dex, Wil. Take your top two results and add them together for your result. For Rfx roll a d10 and take the result.

Roll 1d6 to determine your characters Hit Points.

### Inventory

Every character starts with 6 inventory slots. If a backpack is purchased this goes up to 10 and frees your hands. Later a cart or beast of burden can be purchased. Fatigue can take up a slot. Finally look at the marketplace (see appendix) and use your starting gold to buy equipment, armor, weapons, and gear?

Levels are not important in compendium, moreover, magic items and skills will fill this void.

<h2 id="core-rules">Core rules</h2>

### Initiative

Everyone including Beasts have a reflex score. Battles will go in the order of lowest to highest.

### Attacks/Challenges

For compendium play we use a roll under system. If you are attacking you roll at or under your strength for a hit. 0 is a critical hit, and 20 is a critical miss. Lock boxes might use dexterity, while fighting and enchantment might require willpower.

Death comes for us all.

If your character meets their end in a battle and they are healed within the battle you will revive with no long term consequences. However, if your group has to wait until the battle has ended, you will have to roll for a scar. A scar will take an inventory slot, and will plague you in some specific way e.g., leg scar might deduct from your strength, until it too can be properly healed.

This base version of the game should feel like a movie rather than a tactical exercise. There will be other modules that can be added to make the game play more crunchy
