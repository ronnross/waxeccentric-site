        <p>
            I once heard water is the source of all life. So that seems like a
            great liquid to work with. It makes it nice that we can just turn on a
            tap to get it.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since we have already done the hard work of creating the meter, we
            should build on that good work and use it to create our volume
            measurement.
            <br />
            <br />
            My first thought is we can build a box 1m wide, 1m deep, and 1m tall
            (1m<sup>3</sup>).
            <br />
            <br />
            ðŸš¨ Wait!
            <br />
            <br />
            Without even constructing the box I can tell that is going to be a lot
            of water. Perhaps we should start smaller. Maybe only a 10th, and if
            you remember we already defined that as a decimeter.
            <br />
            <br />
            Let&apos;s take the decimeter and create a box.
        </p>
        <div class="squareArea">
            <span class="measureTop">1dm</span>
            <div class="square">&nbsp;</div>
            <span class="measureSide">1dm</span>
        </div>
        {{ meterStick.MeterStick([ "0" , "1" , "2" , "3" , "4" , "5" , "6" , "7" , "8" , "9" , "10" , "11" , "..." , "100"], "centimeter") }}
        <p>
            Now let&apos;s set the height, width, and depth to 1 decimeter or 1dm
            <sup>3</sup>.
        </p>
        <Cube height="128px" />
        <p>
            That will work. Now for a name. We can pull an old measure name from
            the Greek archives. How about an old Greek measure no longer in use;
            litra or for us a liter. We are nearly finished.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now we can apply our pattern from the meter.

            Great job!
            <br />
            <br />
            The really interesting part of this is the relationship between the
            meter. I imagine if we keep building off one another this relationship
            will prove helpful.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now I&apos;m curious how much does this liter weigh?
