        <p>
          Everyone needs to measure things. Perhaps we should measure together
          with a common system. This system should have a high emphasis on being
          practical and simple. Maybe the easiest way to get started is with
          distance. We need a place to start for measuring length. What about
          this?
        </p>
        {{ meterStick.MeterStick(["0", "1"], "centimeter") }}
        <MeterStick units={["0", "1"]} />
        <p>
          This <i>ruler</i> is arbitrary for now. It is some random fixed width
          for the moment with several equally spaced lines. We need to name our
          ruler so it is not confused with anything else. Let&apos;s use ...
        </p>
        <div class="mediaBox">
          <div class="textArea">
            <h2>Meter</h2>
            <p>
              It comes from the Classic Greek word <i>Metron</i> meaning to
              measure.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="imageArea"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Ok, now we have a name and some set length. We are all set! Let&apos;s
          put it use. For our first experiment we can measure our hand üñê.
        </p>
        <p>
          üö® Well, we have already encountered a problem. Our hand is less than
          the length of our ruler. Seems we need to divide our ruler into
          smaller peices. <br /> ü§î <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&apos;s see if cutting into smaller pieces fixes this issue.
          Let&apos;s try 100 sections, and since we already started with a
          classic language let&apos;s continue. We chose Greek for our whole
          measure let us use Latin for our fractional units so we can tell the
          difference if we are using smaller units or whole units. Do not over
          think the naming. 100 in Latin is <i>Centum</i>. With a little
          conjugation we get <i>Centi</i>. Add that with our ruler&apos;s name
          we have <i>Centimeter</i>.
        </p>
        {{ meterStick.MeterStick(["1", "2", "3"], "centimeter") }}
        <MeterStick
          units={["1", "2", "3", "4", "...", "97", "98", "99", "100"]}
        />
        <h3>Great! üéâ </h3>
        <p>
          We get just over 19 centimeters (or 19cm). But our hand hangs just
          over one of the number markers. Perhaps we need to divide the ruler
          event more.
          <br />
          <br />
          Let&apos;s add another 0 and try 1000. Using the same method as before
          1000 in Latin is Milli. Adding our ruler name we have{" "}
          <i>Millimeter</i>
        </p>
        <MeterStick
          units={["1", "10", "20", "30", "...", "970", "980", "990", "1000"]}
          graduations="millimeter"
        />
        <p>
          That gives us more accuracy. The hand we measured comes to 19.3cm or
          193 millimeters (193mm). With this success let&apos;s set our sites on
          something longer like ourselves. Let&apos;s measure our height. Ok,
          now we have a different problem. Our ruler is not large enough so we
          have to use more than one ruler.
        </p>
        <p>
          We get 1 ruler (or 1 meter) and 70 centimeters (average height in the
          U.S.). We can add them together using a decimal form and get 1.7
          meters (or 1.7m).
          <br />
          <br />
          Now I&apos;m getting excited. Mainly because it is so easy to move
          between the units.
        </p>
        <div class="mediaBox">
          <div class="textArea">
            <h2>Base 10</h2>
            <i>1.7m</i>
            <i>170cm</i>
            <i>1700mm</i>
          </div>
          <div class="imageArea"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I can do this in my head with little thought. That is what I call
          simple and practical just like our system for currency.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should try one last thing. Measuring a great distance. Let&apos;s
          measure how far we are from our favorite restaurant.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ok I have mine. I&apos;m going to lay the meter sticks end to end
          until I reach my destination.
        </p>
        <MeterStick
          units={["1", "10", "20", "30", "...", "970", "980", "990", "1000"]}
          graduations="millimeter"
        /><MeterStick
          units={["1", "10", "20", "30", "...", "970", "980", "990", "1000"]}
          graduations="millimeter"
        /><MeterStick
          units={["1", "10", "20", "30", "...", "970", "980", "990", "1000"]}
          graduations="millimeter"
        /><MeterStick
          units={["1", "10", "20", "30", "...", "970", "980", "990", "1000"]}
          graduations="millimeter"
        />
        <p>
          Oh wow! It took me 1,100 sticks. What about you?
          <br />
          Well I&apos;m thinking we need a name for large measure, because
          I&apos;m not saying 1 thousand and 100 meters all the time. How about
          we use 1000 like we did when dividing our ruler. I know you might be
          thinking we cannot use Milli or it will cause issues. Well remember
          what we said earlier? We are using Greek for large measures. Greek for
          1000 is Kilo. Now we have a Kilometer or km. My favorite restaurant is
          1.1km from my home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me take some liberties and fill out the rest of measure names and
          add it to a table.

          We have one last problem to solve. I have the ruler here at my home.
          How do I get this ruler to you? I mean I could always mail it, but
          what happens if it gets damaged, lost, or worse shrinks a little over
          time.
          <br />
          <br />
          We need something more reliable to share the exact size of our ruler.
          It should be something outside of a physical object. So light is very
          abundant. We can define a meter as the length of the path tavelled by
          light in a vacuum in
          <br />
          <br />
          <div class="mediaBox">
            <div class="textArea">
               <span role="math" class="Equation">
              <div class="group">
                <span class="num">1</span>
                <span class="sr-only">/</span>
                <span class="den">299,792,458</span>
              </div>
              <div>of a second</div>
            </span>
            </div>
            <div class="imageArea"></div>
          </div>
          <br />I can give you this equation. Now you would need some equipment
          to measure light in a vacuum, but the point is you do not something
          physical to create rulers for you or your friends. If we stick to the
          equation we all have the same size ruler. Incredible!
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, I&apos;m tired of measuring all that. I think I need a drink.
          Perhaps we can use what we created to measure our beverage.
