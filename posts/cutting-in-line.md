# Cut in line

Lunchtime arrives at the office, and today I plan to join the group for lunch. The usual process involves walking to a location, standing in line, getting the food, and walking back to eat together at a table. However, before anyone leaves the office, most folks have placed their orders in advance. I pass on this since I don't need another app on my phone, nor do I want the bother of another screen.

When we arrive, I stand in a line to place my order while my colleagues grab their food off the counter and wave goodbye as I stand alone. When I arrive back at the office (only five minutes behind the group), they were still setting up for lunch. I think to myself, does ordering online really prove worth it?

When I group asked why I did not order online. I say it feels like cutting in line. I in turn ask the group if it proves worth it, one comments they would rather die than stand in a line. Lines aren't great, but death? Standing in line to order my food represents a minor inconvenience at worst. It seems they spent nearly as much time staring at their phones ordering their food before we left. Moreover, standing in line together eases the process.

Now, this seems like a weird thing to get bothered about. It seems when you can avoid a line, then do so. I would ask: what do you have to do that is so important that you cannot wait a few minutes? Most absorb any free time they save with their phone. Hardly saving lives.

For me, standing in line represents skin in the game. I feel if I fell into the convenience trap of ordering food online, I most likely would eat out more, but having to go through the hoops keeps me bringing my food to work the vast majority of the time.

I also think so many folks ordering online just makes the lines longer, like if you stood in line and folks kept cutting ahead of you.
